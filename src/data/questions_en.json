    "explanation": "In Germany, parents have the right to decide until their child is 14 years old whether it participates in religion classes at school. This is because religion classes are offered as part of the school curriculum in many federal states, but they are not mandatory. Parents can thus shape their child's religious education according to their own beliefs. From the age of 14, the child is allowed to decide for themselves whether they want to continue participating in religion classes, reflecting the growing autonomy and ability to make their own decisions at this age.",

This fundamental right is enshrined in the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany, particularly in Article 16a. It ensures that individuals who apply for asylum in Germany have the right to a fair examination of their application and are protected from being returned to an unsafe country of origin.

    "explanation": "Press censorship is not a characteristic of our democracy because, in a democratic society, freedom of the press and expression are fundamental. Democracy is based on the idea that citizens have access to information and can express their opinions freely without being restricted by the government or other institutions. Press censorship, on the other hand, means that information is controlled or suppressed, which limits transparency and diversity of opinion. Therefore, press censorship contradicts the fundamental principles of a democracy.",

A coalition allows for the unification of different interests and the ability to make political decisions together.",

Article 21 of the Basic Law allows for the banning of parties that endanger the free democratic order or aim to reject or undermine the constitution.

In Germany, there are 16 federal states, and each federal state has its own parliament, which is referred to as the Landtag. During the state elections, citizens elect the representatives who then sit in the Landtag and pass laws at the state level. The term 'state election' is therefore specific to elections at the level of the federal states and differs from other types of elections such as the federal election, which takes place at the national level.",

The municipalities represent the lowest political level and are responsible for local administration and the implementation of laws at the lowest level.

This is correct because the Federal President plays a central role in Germany's political system. According to the Basic Law, the Federal President is tasked with proposing the chancellor after the members of the Bundestag have been elected.

    "explanation": "A change of government in a federal state can influence the composition of the Bundesrat, as the members of the Bundesrat come from the state governments. If the majority in the Bundesrat changes, this can make the enforcement of laws and political decisions at the federal level more difficult. For example, a new majority could vote against the plans of the federal government, leading to blockages and difficulties in implementing political measures.

    "explanation": "The statement is correct because the German electoral system, especially in federal elections, uses a proportional representation system. In this type of election, there are two votes: the first vote for a direct candidate and the second vote for a party. The second votes are crucial for the distribution of seats in the Bundestag. The more second votes a party receives, the more seats it can win in parliament. This happens because the seats are distributed proportionally to the second votes received, meaning that a higher number of second votes directly leads to a larger number of seats.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer 'School obligation' applies to most children in Germany because the German education system legally requires that children between the ages of 6 and 18 attend school. This school obligation ensures that all children receive a basic education, which is important for their personal development and integration into society. The school obligation typically begins with enrollment in primary school and continues in secondary schools.

This legal regulation serves to protect human dignity and the memory of the victims of National Socialism. Those who deny the Holocaust spread false information and thereby violate the societal responsibility to convey history accurately.

    "explanation": "In Germany, social insurance is a system that includes various types of insurance, such as health insurance, pension insurance, unemployment insurance, and long-term care insurance. When you are permanently employed, contributions to social insurance are automatically deducted from your gross salary. This means that both the employer and the employee contribute a portion of the salary to social insurance. These payments are important for being protected in case of illness, in old age, or during unemployment.

    "explanation": "If members of the German Bundestag change their faction, it means that they leave the political group they belong to and switch to another faction. Since the majority in the Bundestag is determined by the number of members in the respective factions, a change of members can lead to the original faction losing its majority. This is particularly relevant when a government coalition is based on a certain number of votes. If members leave the governing faction, the coalition may lose its majority in the Bundestag, which can jeopardize its ability to govern.

This means that the costs for social insurance, which includes benefits such as health insurance, pension insurance, unemployment insurance, and long-term care insurance, are shared. Employers pay a certain percentage of their employees' gross wages, while employees also contribute a portion of their income to these insurances.

    "explanation": "Life insurance does not belong to the statutory social insurance because it is a private insurance that is individually contracted to provide financial security in the event of death or certain life events. In contrast, statutory social insurance includes state-regulated insurances such as health insurance, pension insurance, unemployment insurance, and nursing care insurance, all of which aim to ensure the social security of citizens.

    "explanation": "The electoral system in Germany combines two voting procedures: the majority voting right and the proportional voting right. The majority voting right is applied when electing direct candidates in the electoral districts. Here, the candidate who receives the most votes wins. This often leads to a clear majority in the electoral districts. On the other hand, the proportional voting right comes into play when allocating seats in the Bundestag. Parties receive seats in proportion to the votes they received at the federal level. This ensures that smaller parties are also represented in parliament and that the votes of the electorate are better reflected. By combining these two systems, a balanced representation of voter interests is achieved, making the German electoral system unique.",

This means that all voters have the same influence on the election outcome, regardless of gender, origin, or social status.\n\n3. **Secret**: Voting is done anonymously, so no one knows how a person has voted.

    "explanation": "The correct answer to the question \"What was the economic system of the GDR?\" is \"planned economy,\" because the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was a socialist country that centrally planned and controlled its economy. In a planned economy, the means of production and resources are controlled by the state, and there are no free market forces regulating supply and demand. Instead, economic goals and strategies were set by the government to meet the needs of the population and guide economic development.

    "explanation": "The correct answer to the question of how the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) became one state refers to the process of reunification, which was completed on October 3, 1990. On this day, the five eastern federal states – Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia – joined the Federal Republic of Germany. This occurred after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, which marked the beginning of the end of the division of Germany. The reunification led to the creation of a unified German state, in which the political, economic, and social systems of the FRG were extended to the former territories of the GDR. Therefore, the statement that the five eastern federal states joined the FRG is the central explanation for the reunification of Germany.",
